Templates folder is for global templates.  To make applications portable, write app templates in applications.

From SO:
Placed in <PROJECT>/<APP>/templates/<APP>/template.html for app-specific templates to help with making the app reusable elsewhere.

For general "global" templates I put them in <PROJECT>/templates/template.html
